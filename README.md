# How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software through object-oriented programming by modularizing my code to make it reusable and efficient. I do this by first designing the classes/objects
that I must create, then I implement those objects using OOP principles such as encapsulation to make everything clean and maintain relevant data to each class. This project
taught me a lot about abstracting a program out and I will continue to use this skill for my future work.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I approach development through, as I mentioned above, OOP principles. My development cycle involves a lot of testing and making small changes to see the effect before continuing
development. This made the program easier to understand especially when you have 2k+ lines of code. Visual Studio does not offer a lot of auto-complete or development tools from 
my knowledge so this IDE made it more hands on to write the code.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science is helping me reach my goals by teaching me how exactly software works with hardware to acheive a goal. This class in particular helped develop my understanding 
of graphic programming and how the GPU processes data and outputs it for a user. This program also helped me develop my programming skills in C++.
